The Ranger 1600 PNP comes with servos, ESC, and motor. I think the typical expectation is to have the ESC plug into the
battery, and the 3 wire ESC cable go to a receiver to power it and the servos. I don't know if that will work with my
set up of Mini Wing 405.

The alternative is to use the Power Distribution Board on my Mini Wing 405 and wire it like shown in the 405 documentation.

The first method is simpler and would require no soldering. Maybe I'll try that first.

## Battery Choice
Reading up about the Ranger 1600, some say that a 4000 mAh 3S is ideal for weight an balance and has enough thrust.
Others seem to say that for adding FPV gear we will want a 4S battery.

I'll need to pick up a charger, and go through our old bag of LiPos to see if any might still be good.

I think 4S might be the way to go for now as it should provide more than enough - and maybe enough when we get a camera mounted.

## Radio Tx
Wyatt has a Frsky with TBS Crossfire installed. We will try that first.

## Radio Rx
I purchased a TBS Crossfire Nano Pro receiver for about $40. 

## Update everything

The radio, the TBS Crossfire Module, the TBS Nano, the Flight Controller - possibly the GSP. All have firmware with versions.
Making this automatic - and being able to log equipment - will be its own challenge for later.
