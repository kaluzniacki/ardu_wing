# Thermaling

I met David at the CRRC School field when I saw him flying an EFlight Radian. Not the night radian, which he says is
inferior.
I asked him if he catches many thermals at the field, and he reported having flown three that day. I asked about how he
knows he is in a thermal,
does he have a vario? No vario, he looks for turbulent air, he says you can see the glide behave differently, often
visibly rising.

When I flew, I was taught to pay attention to roll, if a wing went up, you should turn into that wing as it is in rising
air.
So I think we can look for that, but David makes me think we can also look for energetic air, and any turbulence.

## Ardupilot Thermal Support
Ardupilot has some thermaling support, though what I have found suggests it is maybe not easy to use. I'm not certain it is in the build for my F405 Wing Mini FC.


# Addendum
**Question:** Define thermaling

**Grok:** Thermaling is a technique used by pilots, particularly in gliding or soaring aircraft like gliders, sailplanes, or hang gliders, to gain altitude by circling within a column of rising warm air called a thermal. A thermal is a pocket of warm air that rises due to its lower density compared to the surrounding cooler air, often formed by the sun heating the ground unevenly. By skillfully maneuvering within this rising air, pilots can extend their flight time and cover greater distances without an engine, relying solely on the natural lift provided by the thermal. The term is most commonly associated with aviation but can also apply to birds or other airborne creatures using thermals to soar efficiently.
