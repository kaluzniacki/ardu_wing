# Thermaling

I met David at the CRRC School field when I saw him flying an EFlight Radian. Not the night radian, which he says is
inferior.
I asked him if he catches many thermals at the field, and he reported having flown three that day. I asked about how he
knows he is in a thermal,
does he have a vario? No vario, he looks for turbulent air, he says you can see the glide behave differently, often
visibly rising.

When I flew, I was taught to pay attention to roll, if a wing went up, you should turn into that wing as it is in rising
air.
So I think we can look for that, but David makes me think we can also look for energetic air, and any turbulence.
