# Section: CRRCSim

I wanted a training Sim - for me - to brush up on flying an RC plane. I saw how effective VELOCIDRONE was for teaching Quad
flying to my son.

I worked with Grok and CRRCSim came up as free, Mac compatible, and Ardupilot compatible. X-Plane would also be great, I
have used it many times before.

CRRCSim - Charles River RC Simulator, it took a bit of effort on the Mac, and it is antiquated in the UI, but it works
great.
And it is open source - and has been used. When I ran it, I was caught by surprise, the default field is Davis field,
and I have flown there.

I stopped by their other field off Route 2 the other day, and a bunch of folks were flying, including Dave, who was
flying an electric glider.

## Setup

Once I had the app running, setting the launch to give me some speed was key. I don't care for the mouse controls much,
so I'll see if I can get the XBox controller set up.
Ideally it would be the Frsky Transmitter configured as the controller, so I can practice with exactly what I will be
using.

## Practice

A bit of practice, mostly for not turning too near the ground, and for keeping an even airspeed, has been good.

Needed to use OpenTX Companion to get Joystick recognized.

MacBook Air M1, Taranis QX7 Access. Couldn't get the Mac to recognize it as a game controller. When I plugged it in with
USD (thought ANKER hub) a prompt would come up on Taranis screen for Joystick or mass storage selected joystick, that
didn't do it. Opened Open TX companion 2.3. Preferences menu, third page under Simulator settings There's a little box
Joystick Enable. Ticked that, now I'm playing Aerofly 9!"_

Had to restart CRRC Sim after using OpenTX to enable joystick - this was in the settings panel. Still need to configure
a bit to get the right channel and inversion mappings. Not clear if the model I have has ailerons. And, it would be good
to select an electric model. The Allegro E-Lite worked very nice. It took some config, but I think this will help prep
me for actually flying. I could either look for a Ranger 1600 model for CRRC Sim, or maybe just increase the wing
loading on the Allegro to get it to handle more like I expect the Ranger to fly. I could also try that pattern ship
which should be a faster. I wonder if I can put Ardupilot SITL into CRRC to get my own configurations and fly autopilot
and so on. I expect to have a flying plane soon, so I should look at the fields - maybe in QGroundControl and plot out
some initial flights, even just getting the trim right and landing.



## Simulation in the Loop

CRRCSim is supposed to be usable in Ardupilot as a SITL solution. I've tried a little bit, and not had luck just yet.
