# Section: CRRCSim

I wanted a training Sim - for me - to brush up on flying an RC plane. I saw how effective it was for teaching Quad
flying to my son.

I worked with Grok and CRRCSim came up as free, Mac compatible, and Ardupilot compatible. X-Plane would also be great, I
have used it many times before.

CRRCSim - Charles River RC Simulator, it took a bit of effort on the Mac, and it is antiquated in the UI, but it works
great.
And it is open source - and has been used. When I ran it, I was caught by surprise, the default field is Davis field,
and I have flown there.

I stopped by their other field off Route 2 the other day, and a bunch of folks were flying, including Dave, who was
flying an electric glider.

## Setup

Once I had the app running, setting the launch to give me some speed was key. I don't care for the mouse controls much,
so I'll see if I can get the XBox controller set up.
Ideally it would be the Frsky Transmitter configured as the controller, so I can practice with exactly what I will be
using.

## Practice

A bit of practice, mostly for not turning too near the ground, and for keeping an even airspeed, has been good.

## Simulation in the Loop

CRRCSim is supposed to be usable in Ardupilot as a SITL solution. I've tried a little bit, and not had luck just yet.
