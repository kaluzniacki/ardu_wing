The Ranger 1600 arrived. It went together pretty easy. I need to better understand the ESC and how I will wire up my system.
Should I use ESC to power the FC, or use the FC power distribution board to power the ESC?
TODO - two options diagram



I need a drawing program - here in PyCharm - Draw.io is nice. Omnigraffel on my Mac is also nice.

What can I do to round trip diagrams with Grok? NOt much really seems to be the answer right now.

## Weather Stations
Portable cheap wireless wind speed/direction - barometer/temperature
Would be great to set 4 of these up in a field. Should be able to count thermals.
Maybe get some stats on wind shear.

## Document organization
I'm still struggling with how to best take notes and organize this document.

I have the goals section - 
- Sim to practice - 
- Aircraft w/ blackbox that I can fly and collect data from.
- Autopilot that I can use for "missions"
- Document how to set up and fly a mission.

But should I stay in MD?
Should I publish with pandoc to latex and pdf?
What about my illustrations?
Should I use WORD?
Should I keep sections in separate files?

I soldered the Speedy Bee 405 Flight controller - non-compas GPS, and all header pins.
The soldering iron of Wyatt does not seem to keep heat properly - I'll have trouble with the thicker wires if 
I can not resolve the issue.

I ordered the 1600 Ranger - $145 from Amazon.
